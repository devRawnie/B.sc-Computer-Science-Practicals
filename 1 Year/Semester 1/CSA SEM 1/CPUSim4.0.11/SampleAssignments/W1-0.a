; This program reads in integers and adds them together
; until a negative number is read in.  Then it outputs
; the sum (not including the last number).

Start:	read		; read n -> acc
	jmpn  Done  	; jump to Done if n < 0.
	add   s  	; add sum to the acc
	store s 	; store the new sum
	jump  Start	; go back & read in next number
Done:	load  s	; load the final sum
	write 		; write the final sum
	stop  		; stop

s:	.data 2 0 ; 2-byte location where sum is stored
